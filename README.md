- So you want to contribute? Yay! Great! Fun! I love seeing my First Project. That being said.

 - The general guidelines I'll follow are:

Does it make developing todo easier?
Does it help other platforms (browser) work better?
Does it stick to the original goal of todo-list (a simple, text-based to-do list)
Does it reduce the build size?
